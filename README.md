# ChampionsLeagueAnalysis
 This repository will serve as my holding place for any visualizations I develop in Tableau or analytics I do in Python in relation to a dataset related to the Champions League. This dataset is linked in the readme and has demographic variables for the city of the respective teams. The observations listed in this dataset are all of the winners, runners up, semi-finalists and quarter-finalist since the start of Champions League.
